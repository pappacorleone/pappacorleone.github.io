<h1>Hi Im Kris</h1>
<h2>I make your product look awesome</h2>
<img src=me.jpg>
<p>I have a unique ability to quickly identify founder vision, assess its strengths and weaknesses and align myself,
the rest of the team, and customers with that vision. Vision alone does not make a successful product or company,
Bringing that vision to life, with a thorough understanding of what needs to get done, is where I excel.
While working in several positions at start-ups since middle-school, I have brought an element of magic to
everything Ive had a hand in producing. Whether it' s finding ways to reach wealthy individuals to invest in
struggling communities, or leading a team of developers to create a service for singles to find the person of their
dreams, I have consistently found new ways of delivering value to organizations and customers alike.</p>
